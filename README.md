# Dice Demo (Using React)

Based on the dice roll exercise as part of Colt Steele's React course.

Simply renders six dice that can be 'rolled' at the click of a button.

Integrates Font Awesome icons for the dice faces, and Animate.css for the roll animation.

Also works nicely with a narrow viewport, ensuring mobile-friendliness.
