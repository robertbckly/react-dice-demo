# Dice Demo (Using React)

(Based on the dice roll exercise as part of Colt Steele's React course on Udemy.)

Simply renders six dice that can be 'rolled' at the click of a button.

Integrates Font Awesome icons for the dice faces, and Animate.css for the roll animation. Also works nicely with narrow viewports.
